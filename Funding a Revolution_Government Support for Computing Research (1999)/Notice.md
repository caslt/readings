    注意：该项目（即该报告的主题）由美国国家研究委员会理事会批准。项目成员来自美国国家科学院、美国国家工程院和美国医学研究所的理事会。负责该报告的委员会人员构成主要的考虑了他们的特殊能力和适当的平衡。美国国家科学院是一个私人、非盈利的、自我延续的社会，由科学和工程研究领域的杰出学者组成，致力于促进科学和技术的发展以及将它们用于大众福利。根据1863国会授予的宪章授权，美国国家科学院的任务是就科学和技术问题向联邦政府提出建议。阿尔伯特*布鲁斯（Bruce Alberts）博士是美国国家科学院的院长。

依照美国国家科学院的章程，美国国家工程院建立于1964年，是一个由杰出工程师组成的一个平行组织
(译者注：美国国家科学院最后扩展为美国国家研究理事会、美国国家工程院、美国国家医学研究院)。
It is autonomous in its administration and in the selection of its members, sharing with the National Academy of Sciences the responsibility for advising the federal government. The National Academy of Engineering also sponsors engineering programs aimed at meeting national needs, encourages education and research, and recognizes the superior achievements of engineers. 
Dr. William A. Wulf is president of the National Academy of Engineering.

The Institute of Medicine was established in 1970 by the National Academy of Sciences to secure the services of eminent members of appropriate professions in the examination of policy matters pertaining to the health of the public. 
The Institute acts under the responsibility given to the National Academy of Sciences by its congressional charter to be an adviser to the federal government and, upon its own initiative, to identify issues of medicalcare, research, and education. Dr. Kenneth I. Shine is president of the Institute of Medicine.

The National Research Council was organized by the National Academy of Sciences in 1916 to associate the broad community of science and technology with the Academy’s purposes of furthering knowledge and advising the federal government. 
Functioning in accordance with general policies determined by the Academy, the Council has become the principal operating agency of both the National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Engineering in providing services to the government, the public, and the scientific and engineering communities. 
The Council is administered jointly by both Academies and the Institute of Medicine. Dr. Bruce Alberts and Dr. William A. Wulf are chairman and
vice chairman, respectively, of the National Research Council.
